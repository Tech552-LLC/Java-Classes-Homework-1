-  Square class with the following instance variables and methods
** instance variable/property : length;
** method: calculateArea
** Create a square object in main and call the method on it

-  Circle class with the following instance variables and methods
instance variable/property : radius;
method: calculateArea
Create a circle object in main and call the method on it

-  Triangle class with the following instance variables and methods
** instance variable/property : radius;
** method: calculatePerimeter();
** Create a triangle object in main and call the method on it

-  Song class with the following instance variables and methods
instance variable/property : title;
instance variable/property : artist;
method1: setTitle;
method2: play;

method3: favoriteTrack
the favoriteTrack Methods takes in an array of song  titles and returns the second to the last track in the array.
for example : String[] trackttiles = {"track1","track2","track3"}. 
Track 2 is obviously the second to the last track. 
BUT if i decide to pass in an array with more tracks like -  String[] trackttiles = {"track1","track2","track3",,"track4"}. The second to the last track in this case is Track 3. Make sense? if not, ask questions

-  NOTE: If i use your favoriteTrack method in main, it should work no matter how many track titles are given/passed to your method when used in main.
Create a song object in main and call the 3 methods on it

# Create a Bicycle Class
instance variable/property : cadence;
instance variable/property : gear;
instance variable/property : speed;

method1: applyBrake, takes in a speed amount and reduces the current speed by the speed amount inputed into your method when used

method1: speedUp, takes in a speed amount and increases the current speed by the speed amount inputed into your method when used

Create a Bike object and use each method on it
